        text: 'Masters of the great plains and mountains of Augea, ogres are among the toughest of all creatures. Famed for their appetites and their brutality alike, the tribes are feared around the world. Do not anger them, for their fury is legendary - and only a fool would stand before the earth-shaking footfall of the Ogre Khans!'

        text: 'Steppe ogres and mountain ogres have developed two quite different cultures. Both are rich and ancient, and can be reasoned with - provided you respect their traditions, and lay on a sufficient banquet. In the days of the greatest Khan of Khans, ogres walked as masters of the great nation of Tsuandan, or so their campfire lore speaks. Today, their reach encompasses the Silk Road, giving access to the wares and riches of many nations. Trading caravans often employ tribes of ogres for protection, often against their own kin. These mercenaries can be as treacherous as they are hungry, for they have come to respect the power of coin, at least so far as outsiders are concerned.'
