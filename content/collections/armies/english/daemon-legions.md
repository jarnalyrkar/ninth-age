        text: 'The hellish agents of the Dark Gods lurk unseen behind the thinnest of barriers separating our world from theirs. Enemies of every mortal power, they are merciless and single-minded, appearing in every hideous form, an endless writhing throng of horror. Submit to the summoning ritual, and test your sanity before the Daemon Legions.'

        text: 'Within the maelstrom of shifting power that is the Abyss, there are greater and lesser currents that represent the infinite forms of the Legion. At the heart of these vortices lie the Dark Gods, and Father Chaos behind them, for only the most powerful of Supernals can forge their own path in the Immortal Realm. The Mortal Realm, however, offers new prospects, for here a daemon can manifest in whichever kind of physical form it desires. This it uses to sow discord and despair, all in service of dark masters and unfathomable goals.'
