        text: 'As tough as the mountains themselves, and with memories that last almost as long, many dwarves carve their homes from the very bones of the earth. Forgers of the finest works of steel and gold, they are as mighty as they are determined. Should you try to take that which is theirs, you will face the full vengeance of the Dwarven Holds!'

        text: 'Though the Dwarven Empire fell at the end of the Golden Age, the Holds still control the most lucrative mines of Vetia, producing the finest armours and jewellery. Despite their strong personalities, fierce individuality and allegiances to family and clan reaching back centuries, every dwarf knows their place and would lay down their lives for their Hold.'
