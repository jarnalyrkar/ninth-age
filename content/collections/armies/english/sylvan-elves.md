        text: 'From the greatest forests to the humblest desert oasis, wherever trees take root, there you may feel the weight of unseen eyes, or sense a tremor of movement among the boughs. Yet raise a blade to those sacred groves and you may feel the wrath of their protectors â€“ the Sylvan Elves.'

        text: 'Believing themselves the oldest and truest of the Elven civilisations, the woodland Fae are a source of frightening stories across the world. Proud and merciless, their ancient magics and mastery of their primordial homes grant the Sylvan Elves a reputation of mystery and treachery that is well deserved. It is said the elves nurture the very spirits of the wood, who follow them to war beneath the canopy. Those same spirits are murderous when roused, and terrifying when combined with lethal Sylvan archery and a human borders.'
